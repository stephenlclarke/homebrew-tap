# Homebrew Tap

Homebrew tap for `stephenlclarke` tools and games:

```sh
brew tap stephenlclarke/tap
brew trust --tap stephenlclarke/tap
```

## Container Release Stack

The stable `container` and `container-compose` formulae install the matched
prebuilt runtime and Docker Compose v2 plugin. The canonical five-repository
stack map and current dependency pins live in `container-compose`'s
[README](https://github.com/stephenlclarke/container-compose#project-repositories)
and [STATUS.md](https://github.com/stephenlclarke/container-compose/blob/main/STATUS.md).

The four component source repositories and this tap use `main`. Bare semantic
`container-compose` tags publish stable plugin assets and update this tap after
package, checksum, and formula verification. Source submodules are maintenance
inputs only; Homebrew installs do not build from them.

Install the matched runtime and plugin:

```sh
brew install stephenlclarke/tap/container-compose
brew postinstall stephenlclarke/tap/container
brew services restart stephenlclarke/tap/container
container system version
container compose version
```

Complete install, upgrade, migration, and removal instructions live in
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). Release policy lives in the
[`container-compose` branch guide](https://github.com/stephenlclarke/container-compose/blob/main/BRANCHES.md).

## Games

`maze`, `mazewar`, `bzflag`, `asteroids`, and `defender` build a native macOS app bundle from their current `main` source and install a launcher command.

| Formula | Install command |
| --- | --- |
| `maze` | `brew install --HEAD stephenlclarke/tap/maze` |
| `mazewar` | `brew install --HEAD stephenlclarke/tap/mazewar` |
| `pacman` | `brew install stephenlclarke/tap/pacman` |
| `battlezone` | `brew install stephenlclarke/tap/battlezone` |
| `bzflag` | `brew install --HEAD stephenlclarke/tap/bzflag` |
| `asteroids` | `brew install --HEAD stephenlclarke/tap/asteroids` |
| `defender` | `brew install --HEAD stephenlclarke/tap/defender` |

## FIX Decoders

The language-suffixed binaries can coexist:

| Formula | Install command |
| --- | --- |
| `fixdecoder-go` | `brew install stephenlclarke/tap/fixdecoder-go` |
| `fixdecoder-java` | `brew install --HEAD stephenlclarke/tap/fixdecoder-java` |
| `fixdecoder-rs` | `brew install stephenlclarke/tap/fixdecoder-rs` |
| `fixdecoder-zig` | `brew install --HEAD stephenlclarke/tap/fixdecoder-zig` |

## Utilities

| Formula | Install command |
| --- | --- |
| `sqlterm` | `brew install --HEAD stephenlclarke/tap/sqlterm` |

## Dev Containers For Apple container

`devcontainer` provides Dev Containers compatibility for Apple's stock `container` runtime on Apple-silicon Macs running macOS Tahoe.

The formula installs only this project's `devcontainer`, compatibility-engine, and Compose-dispatch commands. It does not install, remove, replace, relink, start, or stop:

- Apple's `container` package.
- A custom `container` runtime.
- `container-compose`.

The formula depends on the upstream Docker CLI and Docker Compose protocol
client. It does not install or start a Docker engine. Install Apple's stock
runtime separately from Apple before using the Apple backend.

### Stable

The stable formula follows immutable bare semantic releases:

```sh
brew tap stephenlclarke/tap
brew trust --tap stephenlclarke/tap
brew install --formula stephenlclarke/tap/devcontainer
/usr/local/bin/container system start
brew services start stephenlclarke/tap/devcontainer
devcontainer doctor --container /usr/local/bin/container
```

Stable assets use:

```text
devcontainer-release-arm64.tar.gz
devcontainer-release-arm64.tar.gz.sha256
devcontainer-release-arm64.tar.gz.context.json
devcontainer-release-arm64.tar.gz.verification.json
build-info.json
devcontainer.spdx.json
notarization.json
```

Homebrew infers the stable formula version from the immutable tag-bearing URL. The formula does not repeat a redundant explicit `version` declaration.

### Current

The opt-in Current formula follows the newest validated `main` package:

```sh
brew tap stephenlclarke/tap
brew trust --tap stephenlclarke/tap
brew install --formula stephenlclarke/tap/devcontainer-current
```

Current uses:

- Mutable GitHub prerelease/tag: `current`
- Immutable candidate asset: `devcontainer-current-<sha12>-arm64.tar.gz`
- Monotonic formula version: `current.<github_run_number>.<sha12>`

Stable and Current cannot coexist because they install the same executables. The optional Current formula declares a conflict with `devcontainer`; install one channel at a time and uninstall the active channel before switching.

### Requirements

Both formulae declare:

```ruby
depends_on arch: :arm64
depends_on "docker"
depends_on "docker-compose"
depends_on macos: :tahoe
```

Published ports require Local Network access for the selected runtime's
`container-runtime-linux` helper. Stock Apple and separately installed custom
runtime helpers may appear as distinct entries under **System Settings →
Privacy & Security → Local Network**; authorize each runtime that will be used.

Neither formula declares a dependency on:

```ruby
"stephenlclarke/tap/container"
"stephenlclarke/tap/container-current"
"stephenlclarke/tap/container-compose"
"stephenlclarke/tap/container-compose-current"
```

This separation is intentional. `devcontainer`'s supported core compatibility
boundary is Apple's stock runtime. The upstream Docker CLI and Docker Compose
are required protocol clients; a Docker engine and `container-compose` are
optional backends/providers.

### Verify

After installation:

```sh
devcontainer version
devcontainer version --format json
devcontainer --help
container system version --format json
```

The `devcontainer` output reports its source commit and release lane. The `container` output independently confirms which runtime the user selected.

### Optional Compose Provider

The tap does not install `container-compose` for `devcontainer`.

Current supported `stephenlclarke/tap/container-compose` formulae depend on a
matched custom runtime. They must not be installed automatically or described
as Compose support supplied by Apple. Users who deliberately configure a
provider are responsible for its installation and runtime compatibility;
`devcontainer` will report a custom runtime as a separate provider lane.

## Formula Publication Contract

The `devcontainer` source repository owns the formula template and release renderer. This tap owns the generated formula.

Release automation must:

1. Resolve a release-eligible exact source commit.
2. Require exact-commit CI, CodeQL, documentation, and live parity evidence.
3. Require Developer ID signing and an accepted Apple notary submission.
4. Publish a checksum, SPDX SBOM, build info, and GitHub provenance attestation.
5. Re-download the published archive and checksum.
6. Verify archive integrity, expected entries, signature, and checksum.
7. Render only `Formula/devcontainer.rb` or `Formula/devcontainer-current.rb`.
8. Run `ruby -c`, `brew style`, and strict audit.
9. Commit one Conventional Commit to the tap.
10. Install the formula, run `brew test`, and compare installed provenance with the selected commit.

Stable and Current tap updates share one non-cancelling concurrency group so they cannot race.

## Formula Shape

```ruby
class Devcontainer < Formula
  desc "Dev Containers compatibility for Apple's container runtime"
  homepage "https://github.com/stephenlclarke/devcontainer"
  url "https://github.com/stephenlclarke/devcontainer/releases/download/1.0.1/devcontainer-release-arm64.tar.gz"
  sha256 "RELEASE_SHA256"
  license "Apache-2.0"

  depends_on arch: :arm64
  depends_on "docker"
  depends_on "docker-compose"
  depends_on macos: :tahoe

  def install
    bin.install "bin/devcontainer"
    bin.install "bin/devcontainer-engine"
    bin.install "bin/devcontainer-compose"
    libexec.install "libexec/container"
    pkgshare.install "share/devcontainer"
  end

  service do
    run [opt_bin/"devcontainer-engine"]
    keep_alive true
    process_type :interactive
    log_path var/"log/devcontainer.log"
    error_log_path var/"log/devcontainer-error.log"
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Install either the stock Apple container package or a compatible
      container distribution before starting the service.

      Start Apple's stock runtime:
        /usr/local/bin/container system start

      When macOS requests Local Network access for the selected runtime's
      container-runtime-linux helper, choose Allow. Stock and custom runtime
      helpers may appear as separate permission entries.

      Start the compatibility engine:
        brew services start #{name}

      Use it without changing your default Docker context:
        eval "$(devcontainer context)"

      Configure VS Code's Dev Containers extension to use:
        #{opt_bin}/devcontainer-compose

      Register the optional Apple container CLI plug-in explicitly:
        devcontainer plugin register
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "1.0.1", shell_output("#{bin}/devcontainer version --short")
    assert_match "DOCKER_HOST", shell_output("#{bin}/devcontainer context")
    assert_path_exists libexec/"container/plugins/devcontainer/config.toml"
    assert_predicate libexec/"container/plugins/devcontainer/bin/devcontainer", :executable?
  end
end
```

The Current template changes the class, formula name, version, URL, and expected lane, and adds `conflicts_with "devcontainer"` while preserving the runtime-neutral install.

## Tap CI

Source-repository pull requests and pushes render a formula fixture and run:

```text
ruby -c
brew style
```

The protected publication transaction then runs against the staged,
Developer ID-signed and notarized release archive:

```text
brew audit --formula --strict --online
brew fetch --formula --force
brew install --formula
brew test
```

GitHub Actions must be pinned to complete commit SHAs. Tap CI must not start a live Apple VM merely to validate formula installation; live runtime compatibility belongs to the source repository's trusted bare-metal release gate.

## Devcontainer Source Maintenance

Do not add `devcontainer` as a tap submodule. The formula is generated directly from immutable release assets and a source-owned template. This avoids stale source snapshots and keeps the tap's live content limited to installation metadata.
