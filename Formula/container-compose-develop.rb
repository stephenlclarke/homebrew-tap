  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The plugin is installed under:
        #{opt_libexec}/container-plugins/compose

      To make the Homebrew-installed develop container CLI discover it, link it into
      container-develop's plugin directory and restart the container service:
        mkdir -p "$(brew --prefix container-develop)/libexec/container-plugins"
        ln -sfn "#{opt_libexec}/container-plugins/compose" "$(brew --prefix container-develop)/libexec/container-plugins/compose"
        brew services restart container-develop

      This formula installs the develop debug prebuilt release asset:
        container-compose-plugin-develop-debug-arm64.tar.gz
