  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The plugin is installed under:
        #{opt_libexec}/container-plugins/compose

      To make the Homebrew-installed container CLI discover it, link it into
      container's user plugin directory and restart the container service:
        mkdir -p "$(brew --prefix container)/libexec/container-plugins"
        ln -sfn "#{opt_libexec}/container-plugins/compose" "$(brew --prefix container)/libexec/container-plugins/compose"
        brew services restart container

      This formula installs the main release prebuilt release asset:
        container-compose-plugin-main-release-arm64.tar.gz
    EOS
